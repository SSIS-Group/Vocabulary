Vocabulary Builder App will enable you to learn English at no cost at all. This app is built using [React](http://reactjs.org).  
Providing about **5000 different words that are sorted alphabetically**, you can learn now by using two different modes:  
  
1. **Single Word:** This method provides you a random word from the selected letter everytime.  
2. **List of Words:** This will provide you with a list of words from the chosen letter.  
  
The app is hosted online using GitHub and you can start using it [here](https://tejas-nanaware.github.io/Vocabulary/#/).
